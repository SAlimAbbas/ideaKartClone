      "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER“Cool and persuasive... How Democracies Die comes at exactly the right moment.”—The Washington PostDonald Trump’s presidency has raised a question that many of us never thought we’d be asking: Is our democracy in danger? Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have spent more than twenty years studying the breakdown of democracies in Europe and Latin America, and they believe the answer is yes. Democracy no longer ends with a bang—in a revolution or Military coup—but with a whimper: the slow, steady weakening of critical institutions, such as the judiciary and the press, and the gradual erosion of long-standing political norms. The good News is that there are several exit ramps on the road to authoritarianism. The bad News is that, by electing Trump, we have already passed the first one. Drawing on decades of Research and a wide range of Historical and global examples, from 1930s Europe to Contemporary Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, to the American South during Jim Crow, Levitsky and Ziblatt show how democracies die—and how ours can be saved.",

      "India used to contribute approximately a quarter of the world's GDP until 1700 CE. As recently as 1820, this share was a hefty 16 per cent. But the Industrial Revolution shifted the centre of gravity of the global economy towards the West. The pernicious, indeed exploitative, policies of the British added to this shift by greatly impoverishing India. India's own policies during the first four decades following Independence denied it a rapid return to prosperity. But now that it has left those policies behind, opened up its economy and created a large GDP base, India can aspire to return to the prominent position it enjoyed in the global economy for so long. In The New India: A Reformer's Guide, one of the country's foremost economists, Arvind Panagariya, sets out a detailed pathway for India to regain its lost glory.",

Mathematics is the Foundation on which Technology has been built and advanced over the years. The contributions to this growth have come from all over the World and India has been at the forefront of mathematical progress, with its discovery of zero and the modern number system.

      "An introduction to dependent types, demonstrating the most beautiful aspects, one step at a time. A program's type describes its behavior. Dependent types are a first-class part of a language, and are much more powerful than other kinds of types; using just one language for types and programs allows program descriptions to be as powerful as the programs they describe. The Little Typer explains dependent types, beginning with a very small language that looks very much like Scheme and extending it to cover both Programming with dependent types and using dependent types for mathematical reasoning. Readers should be familiar with the basics of a Lisp-like Programming language, as presented in the first four chapters of The Little Schemer. The first five chapters of The Little Typer provide the needed Tools to understand dependent types; the remaining chapters use these Tools to build a bridge between Mathematics and programming. Readers will learn that Tools they know from programming-pairs, lists, functions, and recursion-can also capture patterns of reasoning. The Little Typer does not attempt to teach either practical Programming skills or a fully rigorous approach to types. Instead, it demonstrates the most beautiful aspects as simply as possible, one step at a time.",

Its major premise is that practical programming, like other areas of science and engineering, must be based on a solid mathematical foundation. The book shows that Algorithms implemented in a real programming language, such as C++, can operate in the most General mathematical setting. For example, the fast exponentiation algorithm is defined to work with any associative operation. Using abstract Algorithms leads to efficient, reliable, secure, and economical software.",

    discription:
      "Advances in the practice of Psychiatry have occurred in 'fits and starts' over the last several decades. These advances are evident to anyone long affiliated with the field and are best appreciated through direct experience of living through the times. These advances can also be gleaned from historical overviews in textbooks or the recollections of one's teachers and mentors. Returning to the original papers that have ushered in these changes is rarely done for various, mostly practical, reasons. Filtering through thousands of articles in Psychiatry may prove daunting, access to the manuscripts may be limited (especially for papers not available electronically), and understanding their impact requires a broader context. Moreover, with so much active research currently occurring in various branches of Psychiatry, current practitioners or trainees may find their attention focused on the present, and this is reinforced by electronic search algorithms, which return articles in reverse chronological order. Not surprisingly, citations for articles in virtually all fields decline precipitously for articles over five years old. As scholars and professionals, we are losing touch with our academic heritage. Yet navigating the future of Psychiatry requires a firm understanding of its past. This resource serves as a guide for anyone seeking to understand the evolution of Psychiatry as a Scientific discipline. It does so by summarizing over 100 landmark papers in Psychiatry and placing their Scientific contributions within a historical context. An introductory section sets the stage for the major theoretical constructs within the field, with chapters devoted to ontology and nosology. Subsequent sections examine major facets of the Theory and practice of Psychiatry, such as pathogenesis of psychiatric illness, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and somatic treatments. These sections are divided logically into chapters addressing important contributions to the understanding and treatment of specific disorders. A final section explores ethical considerations within each field. This framework echoes the complexity of Psychiatry, which cannot be reduced to a single set of diagnoses or subspecialty categories. Highlighting the research trajectory of Psychiatry, this resource will appeal to academics, trainees, and practitioners who desire a comprehensive, easy-to-read, up-to-date collection of Psychiatry's pivotal moments. By understanding the challenges, inspirations, and insights from the past, readers will be better poised to address new and ongoing challenges within the field.",

      "The sounds and flavours of the land south of the Vindhyas—temple bells, Coffee and jasmine, coconut and tamarind, delicious dosais and appams—are familiar to many, but its History is relatively unknown. In this monumental study, the first in over fifty years, historian and biographer Rajmohan Gandhi brings us the South Indian story in modern times. At heart, the story he tells is one of four powerful cultures—Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu, as well as the cultures—Kodava, Konkani, Marathi, Oriya, Tulu and indigenous—that have influenced them.When the narrative begins at the end of the sixteenth century, the Deccan sultanates of Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Golconda and Bidar have combined to defeat the kingdom of Vijayanagara, one of the last great medieval empires of the South. After the fall of Vijayanagara, less powerful nayakas or sultans ruled the region. Competition raged between these rulers and the many European trading companies. By the seventeenth century, only the French and British remained to fight it out, in association with Indian rulers and princely states.The eighteenth century saw the growth of the kingdom of Mysore, first under Haidar Ali, a Military leader who had briefly served the Nawab of Arcot, and then under his son Tipu Sultan, who annexed parts of present-day Tamil Nadu and Kerala. By now the European presence was growing strong and assertive. And with the fall of Tipu in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War at the end of the eighteenth century, the British East India Company (now the sole European power in South India) consolidated its holdings in the South.In the nineteenth century, power changed hands from the private East India Company to the British monarchy—Queen Victoria became the ‘Empress of India’—and Britain continued consolidating its territory. Despite the tumultuous environment, this century also saw a creative outpouring.The twentieth century saw a change in the relationship between the foreign ruler and the Indian citizenry. No longer content with isolated Military campaigns led by rajas or nawabs, Indians expressed their urge for freedom through democratic outlets. National Parties such as the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League and Regional ones like the Justice Party, Andhra Mahajana Sabha, Dravida Kazhagam and others emerged. Prominent South Indian leaders such as Annie Besant, C. Rajagopalachari, E. V. Ramasami Naicker, Varadarajulu Naidu, K. Kamaraj, Annadurai, Kamaladevi, E. M. S. Namboodiripad, Potti Sriramulu and others took the fight to the British while, at the same time, carrying on campaigns to ensure the dignity of all citizens.After Independence, new states were carved out from the former presidencies and princely states along linguistic lines—Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra. The book ends in the present, with a look at the new generation of political leaders who have taken over from dominant personalities like M. Karunanidhi, N. T. Rama Rao, M. G. Ramachandran, J. Jayalalithaa, K. Karunakaran and Ramakrishna Hegde. It also Covers some of the most significant Figures from other fields such as Narayana Guru, M. S. Subbulakshmi, U. R. Ananthamurthy, Dr Muthulakshmi Reddy and others.A masterpiece in every sense of the word, Modern South India is a rich, authoritative and magnificent Work of History about the South that will be read, debated and reflected upon for years to come.",

      "Description: Scientific Water Toys Steamer, Early Edge Education Toy, Tin Boat - Length 14 cm, Width 6 cm, Height 4 cm (approx). Function: How does it do that? - When the water in the coil boils, the steam expands. This pushes the water out of the tubes. The reaction pushes the boat forward. As the steam continues to expand, it encounters the section of tubing that used to be full of water. This tubing is cold, and the steam condenses back into water. This causes a vacuum to form, which Pulls more water back into the tubes. You would expect that the water moving back into the tubing would cause the boat to go backwards. However, the water doesn't get very far before it hits the end of the tube (the two streams of water in the two tubes meet each other in the coil). Any motion caused by the water being sucked into the tubes is reversed by the water hitting the front of the tube (the coil) and pushing the boat forward again. As you saw when you put your finger near the tubes, this back and forth water motion is fairly rapid, and the comparatively heavy boat never actually moves backwards at all. These are made in India on hand-operated presses, from tin plated steel. hand-painted. They make a wonderfully loud 'putt-putt-putt' sound as the steam around a bathtub,swimming pool or pond. You can (http://sci-toys.com/scitoys/scitoys/thermo/poppop6.avi) to see a Video (with sound) of the little boat speeding around a bathtub. Please Note: Product batch being different so the colors & pattern may have a little difference from Pics Shown, these are fancy Utility items. Kindly analyze & read description, size & measurement details before order.",

And, as Gardening editor of The Sunday Times, Caroline Donald has been allowed beyond the GATE of many a private paradise to share this passion. Included in The Generous Gardener are the stories, in words and pictures, of more than forty private gardens, including those belonging to Jim Carter and Imelda Staunton, Jilly Cooper, William Christie, Harrison Birtwistle, Kelly Brook, Natasha Spender, Catherine FitzGerald and Dominic West, Julian and Isabel Bannerman, Penelope Hobhouse, Bob Flowerdew, Roy Lancaster, Luciano Giubbilei, and Dan Pearson.",

In Barking Up the Wrong Tree, Eric Barker reveals the extraordinary Science behind what actually determines success and most importantly, how anyone can achieve it. You’ll learn:• Why valedictorians rarely become millionaires and how your biggest weakness might actually be your greatest strength • Whether nice guys finish last and why the best lessons about cooperation come from gang members, pirates and serial killers• Why trying to increase confidence fails and how Buddhist Philosophy holds a superior solution• The secret ingredient to “grit” that Navy SEALs and disaster survivors leverage to keep going• How to find work-life balance using the strategy of Genghis Khan, the errors of Albert Einstein and a little lesson from Spider-ManBy looking at what separates the extremely successful from the rest of us, we learn what we can do to be more like them—and find out in some cases why it’s good that we aren’t. Barking Up the Wrong Treedraws on startling Statistics and surprising anecdotes to help you understand what works and what doesn’t so you can stop guessing at success and start living the life you want.",

      "Gain hands-on experience of installing OpenShift Origin 3.9 in a production configuration and managing applications using the platform you built Key Features Gain hands-on experience of working with Kubernetes and Docker Learn how to deploy and manage applications in OpenShift Get a practical approach to managing applications on a cloud-based platform Explore multi-site and HA architectures of OpenShift for production Book DescriptionDocker containers transform application delivery technologies to make them faster and more reproducible, and to reduce the amount of Time wasted on configuration. Managing Docker containers in the multi-node or multi-datacenter Environment is a big challenge, which is why container Management platforms are required. OpenShift is a new generation of container Management platforms built on top of both Docker and Kubernetes. It brings additional functionality to the table, something that is lacking in Kubernetes. This new functionality significantly helps Software development teams to bring Software development processes to a whole new level. In this book, we'll start by explaining the container architecture, Docker, and CRI-O overviews. Then, we'll look at container orchestration and Kubernetes. We'll cover OpenShift installation, and its Basic and advanced Components. Moving on, we'll deep dive into concepts such as deploying application OpenShift. You'll learn how to set up an end-to-end delivery pipeline while working with applications in OpenShift as a developer or DevOps. Finally, you'll discover how to properly Design OpenShift in production Environments. This book gives you hands-on experience of designing, building, and operating OpenShift Origin 3.9, as well as Building new applications or migrating existing applications to OpenShift. What you will learn Understand the core concepts behind containers and container orchestration Tools Understand Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift, and their relation to CRI-O Install and Work with Kubernetes and OpenShift Understand how to Work with persistent Storage in OpenShift Understand Basic and advanced Components of OpenShift, including Security and Networking Manage deployment strategies and application's migration in OpenShift Understand and Design OpenShift high availability Who this book is forThe book is for system administrators, DevOps engineers, solutions architects, or any stakeholder who wants to understand the concept and Business value of OpenShift.",

      "Whales are among the largest, most intelligent, deepest diving species to have ever lived on our planet. We have hunted them for thousands of years and scratched their icons into our mythologies. They simultaneously fill us with waves of terror, awe and affection – yet we know hardly anything about them.Whales tend to only enter our awareness when they die, struck by a ship or stranded in the surf. They evolved from land-roaming, dog-like creatures into animals that move like fish, breathe like us, can grow to 300,000 pounds, live 200 years and roam entire ocean basins. Yet despite centuries of observing whales, we know little about their evolutionary past.Palaeontologist Nick Pyenson takes us to the ends of the earth and to the cutting edge of whale research as he searches for the answers to some of our biggest questions about these graceful giants. His rich storytelling takes us deep inside the Smithsonian’s unparalleled fossil collection, to frigid Antarctic waters, and to the arid desert of Chile, where scientists race against time to document the largest fossil whalebone site on earth.Spying on Whales is an illuminating story of Scientific discovery that brings readers closer to the most enigmatic and beloved animals of all time.",

      "While the core of VINE OF THE SOUL (the companion book to WHERE THE GODS REIGN), is the Amazonian plant life and the indigenous people's uses for it, WHERE THE GODS REIGN focuses primarily on the People themselves-though of course, Schultz (who was dubbed the father of ethnobotany by Prince Philip himself) is first and foremost a botanist and plants do figure into the mix: Schultes describes devil's gardens-empty patches in the otherwise thick forests where, for no apparent (or scientific) reason, nothing will grow-with the same precision and wonderment with which he discusses the many plants that grow upon other plants in their effort to get their share of the sun...and much more. But in this fine volume he begins with information about the histories of the various tribes and the lay of the lands on which they live; savannahs, dense forests, quartzite cliffs, sandstone mountains and caves and thunderous waterfalls are all accounted for; and all of his lyrical Essays are accompanied by stunning black and white photographs. (There are over 140 photos in the book.) Schultes is often poetic here as well, describing not only the Geography but, often, the exquisite emotions one experiences observing it in different seasons or different times of the day. Likewise, Schultes describes the People lovingly. He delights in their ability to be happy in spite of poverty, sickness, and, particularly in the case of the women, very hard work. He marvels at their Relationships with animals, many of which they tame, so that their homes are surrounded by birds, monkeys, deer, and even boa constrictors (which live in the rafters and keep the Mice and rat populations at bay). He marvels that while the Children are almost never punished and enjoy a high degree of freedom (especially the boys), they show great respect for their elders as well as a great curiosity and appreciation for their surroundings. Schultes' pleasure-in the land and its people-is our pleasure. He is a remarkable scientist and a most eloquent guide. Reading WHERE THE GODS REIGN is probably as close as most of us will ever get to the kind of experience Schultes had staying in Amazon basin and learning about the many very different alternatives to living a life. But one can't help but long for that experience too. The book threatens to make explorers out of all of us-and a reader can't help but be disheartened upon remembering that there is not much left to explore.",

      "As a practising mortician, Caitlin Doughty has long been fascinated by our pervasive terror of dead bodies. In From Here to Eternity she sets out in search of cultures unburdened by such fears. In rural Indonesia, she observes a man clean and dress his grandfather's mummified body. She meets Bolivian ñatitas (cigarette-smoking, wish-granting human skulls), and discovers the Japanese ritual of kotsuage, in which relatives use Chopsticks to pluck their loved-ones' bones from cremation ashes. With curiosity and morbid humour, Doughty introduces us to inspiring death-care innovators, participates in powerful Death practices almost entirely unknown in the West and explores new spaces for mourning - including a futuristic glowing-Buddha columbarium in Japan, a candlelit Mexican cemetery, and America's only open-air pyre. In doing so she expands our sense of what it means to treat the dead with 'dignity' and reveals unexpected possibilities for our own Death rituals.",

    discription:
      "'Tryst with Reality' is a memoir of an unplanned backpacking trip to the Himalayas that the author, Vishal Bhavsar, undertook with his college friend Sumant Kachru during the summer of 2017. In a matter of 15 days, a normal trip to Himalayas became a 'journey of a lifetime' for both of them. Even though they went on this trip with absolutely no purpose or expectation, they were lucky to experience some of the most beautiful moments of their lives. During their journey, they cried and they laughed, they enjoyed while they struggled, they surrendered even though they were vulnerable, they believed while they questioned, and they learned as they realised. However, according to Vishal the most important thing they did during those 15 days was - they allowed. They allowed things to just happen to them by keeping their hearts and minds open to recognize, understand and appreciate the many ways in which the universe was conspiring for them. 'Tryst with Reality' can be about friendship, adventure, spirituality, travel, pantheism or self-realisation depending upon which aspect establishes a connection with Readers as they read through. Vishal hopes that by the Time Readers finishes reading the book, it inspires them to start their own inner journey.",
